## TCP/IP Client-Server Chat Packet Capture

## Welcome to our network traffic (Wireshark) tour 🦈
In this section, we examine the Client-Server Chat network traffic captured using Wireshark and explain how different types of TCP connections are used throughout the system.

## TCP Handshake Scenarios 🤝
Below are the three main types of TCP handshakes observed in the application.

---

## 1. Launcher-Observer Connection  [ 🚀 → 👀 ]
The *"Observer"* is a hidden TCP connection to the server initiated by the Launcher and kept open continuously.
The Observer connection serves as a persistent monitoring channel, allowing the Launcher to remain synchronized with the server state independently of active chat users.

Its purpose is:
- **Live User Monitoring:** Receives real-time updates about connected users (joins and disconnects).
- **Global Control Operations:** Enables system-wide actions such as: "Show Active Users", "Close All Chats" and "Shutdown System".
- **Architectural Separation:** Maintains a clear distinction: `Data Plane → Chat Messages` -|- `Control Plane → Observer + Launcher`.

### This handshake consists of:

**`[SYN]` :**  
A connection request sent by the client to initiate the session.

  ⤵️

**`[SYN, ACK]` :**  
The server acknowledges the request and agrees to establish the connection (otherwise nothing happens).

  ⤵️

**`[ACK]` :**  
The client confirms the acknowledgment, completing the connection setup.

Once established, the connection remains open (otherwise nothing happens).

An easy way to identify this connection in Wireshark is by inspecting the packet length:  
it does not exceed **25 bytes**, since the message sent during the handshake is the identifier: __LAUNCHER__.

## 2. Launcher Server Availability Check [ 🚀 → 📡 ]
The Launcher periodically establishes a short-lived TCP connection to verify whether the server is online.  
Once the status is confirmed, the connection is immediately closed.

Its purpose is:
- **Health Check:** Performs a real TCP-level availability check, independent of UI state or local process assumptions.
- **External Verification:** Detects servers started manually or running on other machines within the LAN.
- **UI Synchronization:** Aligns UI state (online/offline indicators, controls) with the actual server status.
- **Fault Awareness:** Identifies crashes or unexpected server termination.
- **Lightweight Design:** Short-lived connection; not part of the messaging protocol and minimal resource usage.


### This handshake consists of:

**`[SYN]` :** A connection request.

  ⤵️
  
**`[ACK]` :** A server acknowledgment (a yes/no answer to the request). 

Indicating whether the connection request was accepted (otherwise nothing happens).

  ⤵️
  
**`[FIN]` :** Connection termination.

## 3. A "New User" Connection [ 🆕 👤 ]
When a new user joins the chat, a dedicated TCP connection is established between the client and the server using a standard **three-way handshake**, as introduced and discussed in the course.

### This handshake consists of:

**`[SYN]` :**  
A connection request sent by the client to initiate the session.

  ⤵️

**`[SYN, ACK]` :**  
The server acknowledges the request and agrees to establish the connection (otherwise nothing happens).

  ⤵️

**`[ACK]` :**  
The client confirms the acknowledgment, completing the connection setup.

  ⏩

❗️ *Immediately after the handshake is completed, the client sends its **username** as the first application-level payload.* --> **`[PSH, ACK]`** 

<br>

Below is the handshake sequence used to create a new user, followed by the packet containing the username ("Vin"):

<div align="center">
<img width="1347" height="968" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d18695de-c055-4293-864e-80e3e99c80cd" />
  </div>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img width="1107" height="668" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8def7304-51b1-4f84-817e-87307202e186" />
  </div>

<br>

The difference between the source and destination IP addresses indicates that the user was created on a different machine than the one hosting the server.

Additionally, the capture shows the randomized port assigned to the client when sending a request to the server(**59772**), which listens on port **8081**.

## Sending a massage 📟
First- let's send a message:

<div align="center">
<img width="648" height="396" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 12 41 11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/666b1a17-a868-419f-9fd7-6dfbe780c3e5" />
</div>

<br>

When a user sends a message, the traffic appears as follows:

<div align="center">
<img width="1049" height="17" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0005833-ace6-4880-9397-f55beced01ae" />
  </div>

<br>

In this example:
- Source IP: `10.0.0.15` (client)
- Destination IP: `10.0.0.16` (server) {*It is always the server's location}
- The packet includes both the client’s ephemeral port (**59772**) and the server’s listening port (**8081**)

<br>

The message payload itself can be observed here ("I am a mistborn"):

<div align="center">
<img width="552" height="116" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce3a154c-d6c6-4ab1-94ad-2bc8d4ecc186" />
</div>

## Reciving a massage 📬
Now let's see what happens when we recive the massage:

<div align="center">
<img width="648" height="397" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 12 41 28" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e9bfebc-4208-4e8c-b54d-d9603ffceb1e" />
</div>

<br>

Since this message is a **broadcast**, the server forwards it to all connected users.  
This is visible in Wireshark by observing multiple outgoing packets from the server, each with a different destination port.

<br>

<div align="center">
<img width="1072" height="49" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7e77c29-5ee5-4e25-8e6b-2d70261104ae" />
</div>

<br>

As we can see the message that was sent for one client ('Client 1') went through the server and sent to all of the other clients that were connected.

- ***Server -> Client 2 :*** `8081 → 61157` , `10.0.0.16 → 10.0.0.15`
- ***Server -> Client 3 :*** `8081 → 61204` , `10.0.0.16 → 10.0.0.15`
- ***Server -> Client 4 :*** `8081 → 59772` , `10.0.0.16 → 10.0.0.15`
- **All the clients were on the same machine, that does'nt have to be the case.*

<br>

<div align="center">
<img width="552" height="116" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 12 32 38" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9056119-5d76-4639-b851-346569696a8c" />
</div>

<br>

We can see that the payload is the message we sent ("I am a mistborn") from Client 1 ("Vin") as a broadcast to everyone ("ALL"). 

**In case its a private massage then he sends this only to one user.*
