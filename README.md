# About Botchat 🤖

A real time chat application built with Python, Raw TCP Sockets, and NiceGUI
Botchat is a full Client Server architecture using pure Python socket libraries for networking wrapped in a responsive web-based interface.
[In case you want to look at part 1 first click here](/PartOne/WireSharkLog.md)


## Key Features ✨
- Pure TCP Networking: Built entirely on Python's standard socket library (no high level wrappers like Socket.IO). (Saddly this was asked for in the project reqirments)
- Real-Time Communication: Instant messaging with support for Global Chat and Private Messaging.
- Multi-User Support: Handles multiple concurrent connections.
- Dynamic UI: Modern interface (NiceGUI was very time saving and helpfull) with auto-scrolling, message bubbles, and notifications.
- Launcher: Fuctions as a control center and an observer.

## How to Run 🏃
You need
- Python 3.8+
- NiceGUI

### easy (and "special") way to run it:

Copy all the code in the project one by one to a open project you have make sure each code is in a diffrent file in that project

### The normal way:
1. Clone the repository: 

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-lan-chat.git
cd python-lan-chat`

2. Install dependencies:

`pip install nicegui`

3. Run the Application:

`python Run_App.py`

## How to Use the app
### Running the chat and server
There are 2 ways to open the server
- run the server file
- in the app luncher that opens after running the run_app file there is a button in the upper right corner
  *This button might not work if you try to use the chat in a lan network in that case run the server file before run_app.

### Adding a user
This luncher is what you should see after running run_app

## How to run chatbot on local LAN (Multiple Computers) 🌐

1. Find your IPv4 Address (Run ipconfig in CMD). [How to Enter cmd](/Guides/How to open cmd.md)
2. Open Common_Setups.py.
3. Update the SERVER_IP variable:
`SERVER_IP = '*.*.*.*'  # Replace with YOUR local IP`
4. Ensure your Windows Firewall allows inbound traffic on the port defined in SERVER_PORT if it does not work just disable the firewall
