# About Botchat 🤖

A real-time chat application built with Python, Raw TCP Sockets, and NiceGUI.
Botchat is a full Client-Server architecture using pure Python socket libraries for networking wrapped in a responsive web-based interface.

## Key Features ✨
- **Pure TCP Networking:** Built entirely on Python's standard socket library (no high-level wrappers like Socket.IO). (Sadly this was asked for in the project requirements 😉)
- **Real-Time Communication:** Instant messaging with support for Global Chat and Private Messaging.
- **Multi-User Support:** Handles multiple concurrent connections.
- **Dynamic UI:** Modern interface (NiceGUI was very time-saving and helpful) with auto-scrolling, message bubbles, and notifications.
- **Launcher:** Functions as a control center and an observer.

## How to Run 🏃

First of all, you need:
- Python 3.10+
- NiceGUI

### Easy (and "special") way to run it:

Copy all the code in the project one by one into an open project you have. Make sure each file from this repo is copied into a separate file in that project.

### The normal way:
1. Clone the repository: 

```py
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-lan-chat.git
cd python-lan-chat
```

2. Install dependencies:

```py
pip install nicegui
```

3. Run the Application:

```py
python Run_App.py
```

## How to Use the App 👨‍💻

### Running the chat and server
There are 2 ways to start the server:
1) Run the `Main_Server` file and then start the app from the `Run_App` file.
2) In the app launcher (that opens after running the `Run_App` file), there is a toggle with an indicator in the upper left corner, switch it on, and that’s it.
    - *This button might not work if you try to use the chat on a LAN network.
      In that case use method number (1).

### Adding a user

This launcher is what you should see after running `Run_App`:

</div>

1) **Create a User:**

   Enter a nickname in the Launcher to open a new chat window. Press 'Enter' or "LAUNCH CHAT".

   That’s it — a new chat user is created and opened in its own window.

</div>

2) **Edit User Details:**

   You can change your username by clicking the name field at the bottom-left of the chat window.
 
   You can also change your avatar by clicking the avatar image on the top-left.

<div align="center">

</div>

3) **Launcher Management:**

   The Launcher allows you to view connected users, close all chat windows simultaneously and even shutdown the whole system.

## How to run chatbot on local LAN (Multiple Computers) 🌐

1. Find your IPv4 Address (see guide for further explanation- [How to Find your IP](/Guides/How_to_find_your_IPv4_Address.md))
2. Open [Common_Setups](/BotChat/Common_Setups.py).
3. Update the SERVER_IP variable:
`SERVER_IP = '*.*.*.*'  # Replace with YOUR local IP`
4. Ensure your Windows Firewall allows inbound traffic on the port defined in SERVER_PORT if it does not work just disable the firewall
